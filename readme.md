## 📂 Project Structure  

### 🏗 **Main Components**

### ⚙️ Core Application Files  
1. **`app.py`** – Application Entry Point  
   This file **runs the Flask application** by calling the `init_app()` function from `app_factory.py`.  
   - **Imports and initializes the app** using the factory function.  
   - **Runs the app** in **debug mode** when executed directly (`python app.py`). 

2. **`app_factory.py`** – Application Factory  
   This file is responsible for **initializing and configuring** the Flask application. Instead of defining the app in a single file, `app_factory.py` follows the **Factory Pattern**, which makes the app modular and scalable.  

   Key functionalities:  
   - **Loads environment variables** using `dotenv`, ensuring sensitive data is kept secure.  
   - **Configures Flask settings**, including secret keys, database connections, and session management.  
   - **Sets up an upload folder** (`static/uploads`) for storing user-uploaded images, with a file size limit of **6MB**.  
   - **Initializes Flask extensions**, such as:  
   - `SQLAlchemy` for database management.  
   - `Migrate` for handling database migrations.  
   - `Flask-Session` for user session management.  
   - `Flask-WTF` with CSRF protection.  
   - **Configures Flask-Mail** to allow email notifications (credentials stored in `.env`).  
   - **Registers all routes** from the `routes/` directory.  
   - **Prevents browser caching** by modifying response headers.  

This modular setup is based on the **App Factory Pattern** and ensures that the app remains **organized, secure, and easy to maintain**. Also, this separation of concerns makes the project **more scalable** by keeping the initialization logic (`app_factory.py`) independent from the execution logic (`app.py`).


### 🗂 Complementary Files
1. **`helpers.py`**  – Utility Functions for PetPal
   This file contains **helper functions and decorators** that simplify various tasks across the application, enhancing **code organization and reusability**.
   `helpers.py` enhances the application's **security**, **data management**, and **visualization capabilities**, avoiding code repetition and making `PetPal` more **efficient and user-friendly**.
      - **`login_required(f)`** – A decorator that ensures users are logged in before accessing certain routes. If not authenticated, the user is redirected to the welcome page.  
      - **`inject_pets(f)`** – A decorator that retrieves the user's pets from the database and makes them available globally (`g.pets`) for templates and views. 
      - **`error_message(message, code)`** – Renders an error page using a custom template (`error.html`), displaying an `http.cat` image based on the error code.  
      - **`allowed_photo_file(filename)`** – Validates if an uploaded file has an allowed image extension (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`).  
      - **`delete_pet_from_db(pet, db)`** – Deletes a pet and all its associated data, including:  
         - Profile and gallery photos.  
         - Logs, weight records, vaccines, medications, and deworming records.  
      - **`create_weight_graph(dates, weights, title, xlabel, ylabel, color, show_days_only=False)`**  
         - Generates a **weight tracking graph** for pets using `matplotlib`.  
         - Filters out missing data points, formats the x-axis for better readability, and **returns the graph as an SVG** for responsive rendering.  


2. **`models.py`**  – Database models for the project
   Defines the structure of tables using SQLAlchemy, including the `User`, `Species`, `Breed`, `Pet`, `Photo`, `Log`, and `Tracker` models (weight, vaccine, internal/external deworming, and medication). It provides structured relationships between users and their pets while allowing tracking of various health metrics and activities related to pet care. Each model includes methods for converting data into dictionary format for easy serialization, which is useful for data manipulation within the application.

3. **`forms.py`**  – Flask-WTF forms for PetPal
   Includes forms utilizing the Flask-WTF extension for streamlined form handling. Flask-WTF forms are extensively used throughout the project to securely and effectively manage user input information. They are employed in various processes, including user registration and authentication.
   Each pet, log, and tracker (covering weight, vaccinations, deworming, and medication) has its own dedicated form to facilitate the creation and submission of new entries. Additionally, the `PhotoForm` is responsible for handling the upload of new photos for pets.

4. **`extensions.py`** – Flask Extensions Initialization  
   This file is dedicated to **initializing and managing Flask extensions** used throughout the application. By defining extensions in a separate file, we avoid **circular imports** that could occur when multiple files depend on the same extensions.  

   The following Flask extensions are initialized here:  
   - **`SQLAlchemy` (`db`)** – Provides an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for database interactions. This allows for defining models in Python instead of writing raw SQL queries.  
   - **`Flask-Migrate` (`migrate`)** – Handles database migrations, making it easy to apply and track changes to the database schema over time.  
   - **`Flask-WTF CSRFProtect` (`csrf`)** – Adds CSRF protection to forms, preventing cross-site request forgery attacks and enhancing security.  
   - **`Flask-Session` (`session`)** – Manages user sessions, allowing for persistent data storage across requests. The app is configured to use the filesystem for session storage.  

   By centralizing these extensions in `extensions.py`, the project maintains **better organization, avoids import errors, and improves maintainability**. Each extension is later initialized within `app_factory.py`, ensuring proper integration with the Flask app.  

5. **`requirements.txt`** – Dependencies
   `.txt` file to easily install all the dependencies required for PetPal.

6. **`breeds.py`**
   Contains a dictionary of all allowed dog and cat breeds for the app. This data is used to populate the database via migrations, ensuring that only valid breeds are available for selection when adding pets to the system.
